# ESPHome Maidsite Desk Component

[ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) component for controlling Maidsite desk controllers via their serial protocol.

## Usage

### What you need

* ESPHome compatible microcontroller (e.g. ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ...)
* RJ12 cable (phone cable, RJ11 may also work)

### Wiring

#### RJ12 connector pinning

Please double check this for your specific model!

pin | function
----|---------
 1  | NC (pulled up)
 2  | GND
 3  | TX
 4  | VCC
 5  | RX
 6  | NC (pulled up)

#### Microcontroller pinning

ESP    | desk
-------|-----
GND    | GND
5V     | VCC
GPIO3  | TX
GPIO4  | RX

Sometimes the desk controller does not supply enough current, then simply disconnet the VCC pin and plug in a micro-usb/usb-c cable into your ESP board.

## Dev Notes

[Jarvis reverse engineering notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GKZfDFljVX4eQBMawq0-Rc8t0x8V6gjQ5BgAYngPYTo/edit?pli=1&gid=1438530487#gid=1438530487)

To see and send custom UART messages the following esphome code can be used:

``` yaml
esphome:
  ...
  includes: components/common_includes.h

uart:
  - id: uart_bus
    tx_pin: GPIO3
    rx_pin: GPIO4
    baud_rate: 9600
    debug:
      direction: BOTH
      after:
        bytes: 9
      sequence:
        - lambda: UARTDebug::log_hex(direction, bytes, ',');

text:
  - platform: template
    name: "UART message"
    id: uart_msg
    optimistic: true
    min_length: 0
    max_length: 100
    mode: text
    initial_value: "f1,f1,01,00,01,7e"

button:
  - platform: template
    name: "Send UART message"
    on_press:
      - uart.write: !lambda |-
          auto str = id(uart_msg).state;
          str = std::regex_replace(str, std::regex("0x"), "");
          str = std::regex_replace(str, std::regex(",| "), "");
          std::vector<uint8_t> out;
          auto ret = parse_hex(str.c_str(), out, str.length() / 2);
          return out;
```

To be able to use the regex command the file "common_includes.h" must be created in the directory "components".  
The content of the "common_includes.h" must be:

``` c++
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string.h>
```
